#conclusion 
#A study was carried out on a dataseet with varying student information. After initial cleaning, preprocessing, , nd exploratory 
#analysis, the data was standardized, dimensionality reduction was applied and four distinct clusters were formed. The clusters are
#characterised as follows:
#cluster1: High grades, high approvals, paid fees
#cluster2:mixed performance, somedebt
#cluster3:low grades, low approvals, highdebt
#cluster4:near-high performace, moderately high debt
#From the results derived, it can be inferred that cluster 3 has the highest risk of droupout.clusters 2 and 4 may
#require additional monitoring and support to ensure sustainability. Cluster 1 has the lowest risk of dropout and would require 
#little to no attention.
#These results were then validated using the label feature,  Target that indicates wthether or not a student is a dropout. This
#additional analysis further strengthened the previous assumptions made the clusters as it correlated strongly wither earlier conclusions
